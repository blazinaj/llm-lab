## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of LLM Lab seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email** security concerns to: [security@llmlab.dev]
3. **Include** the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We'll investigate and assess the issue within 7 days
- **Updates**: Regular updates on our progress every 7 days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days
- **Credit**: We'll credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer anonymity)

### Vulnerability Types

We're particularly interested in vulnerabilities related to:

- **API Key Exposure**: Any way API keys could be leaked or stolen
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injection attacks through user inputs
- **Content Security Policy (CSP) Bypass**: Ways to bypass our security headers
- **Local Storage Attacks**: Unauthorized access to stored data
- **Authentication Bypass**: Ways to access features without proper authentication
- **Data Injection**: SQL injection or similar attacks against the database
- **Client-Side Code Injection**: Malicious script execution
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Security issues in third-party packages

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- LLM Lab web application
- API integrations and authentication
- Data storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Client-side security implementations
- Dependency security issues

**Out of Scope:**
- Third-party AI provider APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Supabase infrastructure (report to Supabase directly)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- DoS attacks against public instances

### Security Measures Already in Place

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks and unauthorized resource loading
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **API Key Security**: Keys are stored locally and validated before use
- **Direct API Communication**: No proxy servers handle sensitive data
- **Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Secure Headers**: Multiple security headers implemented
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs

### Security Best Practices for Contributors

If you're contributing to LLM Lab, please follow these security guidelines:

1. **Never commit API keys** or sensitive data to the repository
2. **Validate all user inputs** before processing
3. **Use parameterized queries** for database operations
4. **Keep dependencies updated** and review security advisories
5. **Follow principle of least privilege** in code design
6. **Test security features** before submitting PRs
7. **Document security implications** of new features

### Security Updates

We'll publish security updates through:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: For critical vulnerabilities
- **Release Notes**: For security-related updates
- **README Updates**: For configuration changes
- **Security.md Updates**: For policy changes

### Hall of Fame

We maintain a hall of fame for security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:
